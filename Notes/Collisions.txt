 "ASCII" codes for α (224) and ß (225)
 
 - Continuous inellastic:
  |
  |-> For conservative system, energy grows slowly.
  |
  |-> With α = 0.99 and ß = 0, dissipative.
  |
  |-> With α = 1 and ß = 0.1, dissipative. It tends to eliminate x velocity.
  |
  |-> With α = 1 and ß = 0.01, almost conservative.

 - Discrete inellastic:

  |-> For conservative system, energy grows slowly.
  |
  |-> With α = 0.99 and ß = 0, dissipative.
